As a third-year IT student, Iâ€™ve built a strong foundation in the field and chose to specialize in Network Technology to further enhance my skills, particularly in how systems connect and operate efficiently within integrated infrastructures.

In studying System Integration and Architecture, I expect to learn how various technologies and platforms work together as a unified system. I'm especially interested in how scalable, secure, and maintainable architectures are designed, and how integration supports seamless business-IT alignment.

I also look forward to hands-on experience in solving integration challenges using real-world tools. Gaining both theoretical and practical knowledge will prepare me to help design efficient, future-ready systems in a professional setting.
